# Techmech

Techmech is a tool to build and manage your lances in [BattleTech][http://battletechgame.com/].

This is a living readme and a todo list with features, the goals of Techmech are:

- [ ] Allow the theorycrafting of mechs via a drag and drop interface
- [ ] Manage your Mechwarriors via a easy to use interface
- [ ] Create lance compositions from Mechs and Warriors.
- [ ] Support sharing via URLs
- [ ] Have a complete database of all Mech variants, weapons and equiptment.
- [ ] Use serviceworkers to store all the data locally in browser
- [ ] Provide graphical displays with charts and graphs. Also provide a interface showing move and firing distances on a map interface

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4 and runs on Angular 5.
The data is static JSON files with a format I am specifying, and will document. It will be an open format and hopefully can be
useful for other tool builders.

Storage will be local to using browser local and session storage, and eventually other web technologies to help.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
